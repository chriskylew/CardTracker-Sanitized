# SnapBuyMarket — Sanitized Architecture Sample

Flask-based backend system implementing structured ingestion, normalization, pricing analysis, and ROI evaluation workflows for large-scale trading card datasets.

> Sanitized engineering sample only — no private data, API keys, proprietary assets, or production logic included.

Cleans and normalizes raw card rows prior to downstream processing.

### `app/roi/pricing.py`

Functions:

- `trim_outliers()`
- `blended_price()`
- `roi_pct()`

### `app/grading/heuristics.py`

Returns normalized grading scores and classification bands.
